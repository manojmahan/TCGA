Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in rule get_tpm in file /home/mkmahan/TCGA/main.smk, line 15:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
'SolidTissueNormal'_tpm.tsv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
